Let&#8217;s take<br>\nit from the beginning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the United States people use money to transact. That is the standard way<br>\nof doing things. One party has currency that is recognized as valuable by<br>\nthe other party and that currency can be used in exchange for goods and<br>\nservices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In layman&#8217;s terms, what it really comes down to is that whatever is being<br>\nexchanged only has to have value to the two parties involved. This is what<br>\nis referred to as a &#8220;medium of exchange.&#8221; What would be accepted by the<br>\nother individual? Nothing else really matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the parties can agree to a deal where each feels he or she is getting<br>\nequal value, then there is a transaction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, one could trade two Mark McGwire baseball cards for a Mickey<br>\nMantle card and there could be value found on both ends. But for that<br>\n&#8220;barter&#8221; deal to happen, both parties would have to want the specific cards<br>\nin question. There would have to be what is known as a &#8220;coincidence of<br>\nwants&#8221; and this severely limits the scope of transactions from many<br>\nperspectives, including that of time. This is nothing to be taken lightly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a currency that is common to many is used, it makes for easier,<br>\nsmoother transactions that do not have to suffer from the constraints of<br>\nbarter deals. Of course, money, whether it be U.S. or Canadian dollars,<br>\nEuros, Rand or any other kind of commonly-accepted exchange medium, is<br>\nregulated by government entities; this is known as &#8220;fiat currency.&#8221; As<br>\nsuch, it is subject to laws, or lack of same, that would tend to de-value<br>\nit. Governments do not customarily back it, and as you can imagine, this is<br>\nnot a good thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the quest for a currency that could be universal, not dominated by<br>\ngovernment and/or political interests, yet still hold a value for those who<br>\nwish to participate in it, came the concept for bitcoin, which provides for<br>\na medium of exchange that can be accepted by those who have it, and<br>\nacquired by those who want it. It is the perfect &#8220;libertarian&#8221; currency<br>\nbecause there is an atmosphere of self-governance to it that actually works<br>\nin a more orderly fashion than that of, for example, the U.S. dollar, which<br>\ncan be printed at will by government decree, thus creating inflation, which<br>\nis obviously not a healthy situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin cuts through all of that and creates a dynamic by which<br>\ntransactions for goods and services can not only take place anonymously,<br>\nbut without the interference of government or banks. And there are no<br>\nworries about inflationary effects, since the supply of bitcoin will be<br>\nlimited to 21 million.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to put the operation of this system into another perspective,<br>\nthink about it like a cell phone carrier where those who owned phones on<br>\nthat particular network could call each other, while those who were not<br>\nconnected to that network couldn&#8217;t. Having bitcoin plugs an individual or<br>\nentity into a network in such a way as to facilitate activity with others<br>\non that network. And it creates a common thread between those parties that<br>\nmakes transactions not only very possible, but a pleasurable and preferred<br>\nway of conducting business and commerce.</p>\n","link":"https://www.adminbw.sitecr.com/about-us/"}},{"node":{"title":"portsbook Reviews","id":"819b8692-995a-5731-863f-dcb99fac2567","content":"\n<p>portsbook Reviews</p>\n","link":"https://www.adminbw.sitecr.com/portsbook-reviews/"}},{"node":{"title":"contacus","id":"aea1bb0b-364c-5659-8a18-4ef14c334413","content":"\n<div role=\"form\" class=\"wpcf7\" id=\"wpcf7-f374-o1\" lang=\"en-US\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<div class=\"screen-reader-response\"></div>\n<form action=\"/wp-json/wp/v2/pages?per_page=100&#038;page=1#wpcf7-f374-o1\" method=\"post\" class=\"wpcf7-form\" novalidate=\"novalidate\">\n<div style=\"display: none;\">\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7\" value=\"374\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_version\" value=\"5.1.4\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_locale\" value=\"en_US\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_unit_tag\" value=\"wpcf7-f374-o1\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_container_post\" value=\"0\" />\n</div>\n<p><label> Your Name (required)<br />\n    <span class=\"wpcf7-form-control-wrap your-name\"><input type=\"text\" name=\"your-name\" value=\"\" size=\"40\" class=\"wpcf7-form-control wpcf7-text wpcf7-validates-as-required\" aria-required=\"true\" aria-invalid=\"false\" /></span> </label></p>\n<p><label> Your Email (required)<br />\n    <span class=\"wpcf7-form-control-wrap your-email\"><input type=\"email\" name=\"your-email\" value=\"\" size=\"40\" class=\"wpcf7-form-control wpcf7-text wpcf7-email wpcf7-validates-as-required wpcf7-validates-as-email\" aria-required=\"true\" aria-invalid=\"false\" /></span> </label></p>\n<p><label> Subject<br />\n    <span class=\"wpcf7-form-control-wrap your-subject\"><input type=\"text\" name=\"your-subject\" value=\"\" size=\"40\" class=\"wpcf7-form-control wpcf7-text\" aria-invalid=\"false\" /></span> </label></p>\n<p><label> Your Message<br />\n    <span class=\"wpcf7-form-control-wrap your-message\"><textarea name=\"your-message\" cols=\"40\" rows=\"10\" class=\"wpcf7-form-control wpcf7-textarea\" aria-invalid=\"false\"></textarea></span> </label></p>\n<p><input type=\"submit\" value=\"Send\" class=\"wpcf7-form-control wpcf7-submit\" /></p>\n<div class=\"wpcf7-response-output wpcf7-display-none\"></div></form></div>\n","link":"https://www.adminbw.sitecr.com/contacus/"}},{"node":{"title":"FAQs","id":"9dbd26a1-cdd6-5df1-a9bb-39d514f3f135","content":"<p>11</p>\n\n\n<p>Preguntas</p>\n","link":"https://www.adminbw.sitecr.com/faqs/"}},{"node":{"title":"indexReact","id":"1f939fa3-daa5-5f26-ab52-f49f39b6b569","content":"\n<p><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong>&nbsp;is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&#8217;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why do we use it?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using &#8216;Content here, content here&#8217;, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for &#8216;lorem ipsum&#8217; will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Where does it come from?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of &#8220;de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum&#8221; (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, &#8220;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..&#8221;, comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from &#8220;de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum&#8221; by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>\n","link":"https://www.adminbw.sitecr.com/"}}]}}}
