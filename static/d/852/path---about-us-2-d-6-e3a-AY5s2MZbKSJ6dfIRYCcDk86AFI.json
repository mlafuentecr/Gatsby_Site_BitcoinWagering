Let&#8217;s take<br>\nit from the beginning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the United States people use money to transact. That is the standard way<br>\nof doing things. One party has currency that is recognized as valuable by<br>\nthe other party and that currency can be used in exchange for goods and<br>\nservices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In layman&#8217;s terms, what it really comes down to is that whatever is being<br>\nexchanged only has to have value to the two parties involved. This is what<br>\nis referred to as a &#8220;medium of exchange.&#8221; What would be accepted by the<br>\nother individual? Nothing else really matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the parties can agree to a deal where each feels he or she is getting<br>\nequal value, then there is a transaction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, one could trade two Mark McGwire baseball cards for a Mickey<br>\nMantle card and there could be value found on both ends. But for that<br>\n&#8220;barter&#8221; deal to happen, both parties would have to want the specific cards<br>\nin question. There would have to be what is known as a &#8220;coincidence of<br>\nwants&#8221; and this severely limits the scope of transactions from many<br>\nperspectives, including that of time. This is nothing to be taken lightly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a currency that is common to many is used, it makes for easier,<br>\nsmoother transactions that do not have to suffer from the constraints of<br>\nbarter deals. Of course, money, whether it be U.S. or Canadian dollars,<br>\nEuros, Rand or any other kind of commonly-accepted exchange medium, is<br>\nregulated by government entities; this is known as &#8220;fiat currency.&#8221; As<br>\nsuch, it is subject to laws, or lack of same, that would tend to de-value<br>\nit. Governments do not customarily back it, and as you can imagine, this is<br>\nnot a good thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the quest for a currency that could be universal, not dominated by<br>\ngovernment and/or political interests, yet still hold a value for those who<br>\nwish to participate in it, came the concept for bitcoin, which provides for<br>\na medium of exchange that can be accepted by those who have it, and<br>\nacquired by those who want it. It is the perfect &#8220;libertarian&#8221; currency<br>\nbecause there is an atmosphere of self-governance to it that actually works<br>\nin a more orderly fashion than that of, for example, the U.S. dollar, which<br>\ncan be printed at will by government decree, thus creating inflation, which<br>\nis obviously not a healthy situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin cuts through all of that and creates a dynamic by which<br>\ntransactions for goods and services can not only take place anonymously,<br>\nbut without the interference of government or banks. And there are no<br>\nworries about inflationary effects, since the supply of bitcoin will be<br>\nlimited to 21 million.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to put the operation of this system into another perspective,<br>\nthink about it like a cell phone carrier where those who owned phones on<br>\nthat particular network could call each other, while those who were not<br>\nconnected to that network couldn&#8217;t. Having bitcoin plugs an individual or<br>\nentity into a network in such a way as to facilitate activity with others<br>\non that network. And it creates a common thread between those parties that<br>\nmakes transactions not only very possible, but a pleasurable and preferred<br>\nway of conducting business and commerce.</p>\n","acf":{"havesidebar":false}}}
